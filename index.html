<h1>My favorite diving places in Israel</h1>
<div>My name is Arik and I'm 43 years old, I started to dive 7 yers ago.
<br>After a long time of thinking about diving I decided to start a course in Caesarea.</br>
After the first day I knew that I made the right decision.
<br>The course was one week long and it changed my life forever.</br>
I saw an amazing world: the under water world.
<br>After I finished the course I stared to dive more and more and met friends who will be with me all the way.</br>
In the 7 years I've been diving I've been in a lot of places in Israel from Nahariya to Eilat.</div>



 <br><b>These are my top favorite places to dive:</b></br>

 Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater.
 
 <br> Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.</br>
 
 <br> Although the use of compressed air is common, a mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become popular due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives.</br>

 <br>Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a regulator.</br>

 <br>They may include additional cylinders for range extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.</br>

 <br>[3] Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases.</br>

 <br>The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration.</br> Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.[1]
